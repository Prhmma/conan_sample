# conan_sample
simple hello world to test conan package manager and set default chained task as buil action in vscode.
there was a bug with vscode shell, solved but by setting its default to powershell and change exectuioin policy to unrestricted with `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted `.
ofcourse you can always [sign your script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing?view=powershell-7#sign-a-script).
